# Independence

## Of two variates
As discussed in other vignettes, the probabilistic independence of two categorical random variates clearly appears as a **flat eikosogram**.
Two categorical random variates $X$ and $Y$  are distributed **independently** of one another if and only if their corresponding eikosgram is **flat**.

This is because independence is defined by the following relationship
\[Pr(Y \given X) = Pr(Y) \]
so that the conditional probabilities do not change as the value of the conditioning variate ($X$) change.  In fact, the conditional probabilities are identical to the marginal probabilities (as if $X$ were not there).

Equivalently, $X$ and $Y$ are independent if and only if
\[Pr(X \given Y) = \Pr(X). \]


These mathematical equivalences arise as flat eikosograms are flat:
```{r independence Y given X, echo = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5, fig.align="center", out.width="50%", fig.cap = "Independence of variates X and Y"}
independenceExample <- as.table(array(c(10, 40, 15, 60),
                        dim = c(2,2),
                        dimnames = 
                        list(X =c("x_1", "x_2"), 
                             Y = c("y_1", "y_2"))))
```

```{r bivariate independence, echo = TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5, fig.align="center", out.width="50%", fig.cap = "Independence of variates X and Y"}
eikos("Y", "X", data = independenceExample)
eikos("X", "Y", data = independenceExample)
```

Following @Dawid1979, we concisely denote the independence of $X$ and $Y$ by $X \indep Y$ or, being symmetric, equivalently $Y \indep X$. 
Similarly, when $X$ and $Y$ are known **not** to be independent we write $X \notindep Y$.


**Note**:  In the example both $X$ and $Y$ were chosen to be *binary* random variates.  This was done for two reasons.  

- For simplicity of presentation:  had there been more values of either $X$ or $Y$ there would have just been more columns in the eikosogram for the conditioning variate and more flat layers for the response variate.
- In some problems, we prefer to talk about events rather than random variates. The same diagram can be used to discuss events: e.g. we could define the event `A` as occurring whenever `X = x_1` and not occurring when `X = x_2`; similarly the event `B` would be defined as occurring or not whenever `Y` takes values `y_1` or `y_2` respectively.  

## Conditionally

When we have three variates, say $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, the pairwise independences  $Y \indep X$, $Y \indep Z$,  and $Z \indep X$ can be examined by looking at the corresponding eikosograms. 

But we can also construct eikosograms that have more than one conditioning variate and so examine, for example, the conditional probabilities of $Y$ **given the pair of variates** $X$ **and** $Y$.  Some interesting features may result.

For example, consider the following eikosogram
```{r conditional independence, echo = TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5, fig.align="center", out.width="50%", fig.cap = "Conditional independence of variates X and Y"}
eikos("Y", c("X",  "Z"), data = cond_indep, xaxs = FALSE, yaxs = FALSE)
```
The eikosogram has two flat sections, one when $Z = z1$, the other when $Z=z2$.  

Looking only at the left hand flat first, we see from the eikosogram that
\[Pr(Y \given X = x1 \and Z = z1) = Pr(Y \given X = x2 \and Z = z1)\]
for all values of $Y$.  $Y$ is therefore  **conditionally independent** of $X$  when $Z = z1$, which we denote as
\[ Y \indep X \given (Z = z1). \]
It follows mathematically that
\[Pr(Y \given X \and (Z = z1)) = Pr(Y \given Z = z1)\]
for all values of of $Y$ and $X$.  

This latter relation can also be observed directly from the eikosogram by applying the **water container metaphor** to the left hand flat.  To do so, think of the eikosogram as a series of columnar containers with a varying amounts of water each, as shown by the bottom blue rectangles (if $Y$ had more values, think of the containers having liquids of various density to give the layers in each column).  Were the boundary between two neighbouring containers to be perforated, then the liquid in the two containers would redistribute to find a new level across both containers.  If, for example, the boundary between the two neighbouring containers at left (between $X = x1$ and $X = x2$ when $Z = z1$) were to be removed, then the resulting level would unchanged.  Removing this boundary removes the effect of changing $X$ when $Z = z1$; that is, we have marginalized over $X$ with the resulting level becoming $Pr(Y = y1 \given Z = z1)$.  The unchanging level for this particular eikosogram implies the previous result, namely
$Pr(Y \given X \and (Z = z1)) = Pr(Y \given Z = z1)$.

Similarly, the same can be said about the right hand side of the eikosogram where $Z = z2$.  That is, it follows from the mathematics and/or eikosogram that we also have 
\[ Y \indep X \given (Z = z2). \]
Since the conditional independence holds whatever value $Z$ takes, we say more generally that $Y$ and $X$ are conditionally independent of one another given the value of $Z$ and more succinctly write
\[ Y \indep X \given Z \]
to assert that this holds no matter what the values of $Y$, $X$, or $Z$.

Clearly a number of independence relationships are possiblie for any collection of three variates which suggests a broader notation for probabilistic independence might be of some help.

## Prefix notation
$X \indep Y$ is the common notation to express the fact that random variates $X$ and $Y$ are probabilistically independent of one another.   A slight variant of this notation can be used to convey more than pairwise independence.  The idea is to switch to using $\indep$ as a function of any number of variates.  For a pair of variates $\indep(X, Y)$ means, as before, that $X$ and $Y$ are probabilistically independent of one another.  The notation becomes useful when there it has more than two arguments (or variates); it then indicates that all variates are probabilistically independent in every way, a *complete independence* of one another.

This idea is made more precise in this section.  Strictly speaking, the notation is not necessary to understand the rest of the vignette and readers may skip this subsection and return to it after observing eikosograms for the various possible cases of independence involving three variates.  The notation principally permits these case to be symbolically described more succinctly.



As an operator on two or more symmetrically treated variables, the function $\indep(X, Y, Z, \ldots)$ is understood as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\indep (Y, X)
& \mbox{  means } &
Y \indep X \nonumber \\
\indep (Y, X)\given Z
& \mbox{  means } &
Y \indep X \given Z \nonumber \\
\indep (Y, X, Z)
 & \mbox{  means } & 
\indep (Y, X) \given Z, ~~  
\indep (Y, Z) \given X, ~~  
\indep (X, Z) \given Y,\nonumber\\
& &
\indep (Y, X), ~~  
\indep (Y, Z), ~  
\mbox{ and } ~
\indep (X, Z)    
\mbox{ all hold }
\nonumber \\
& &
\mbox{ or in the original (infix) notation, the following all hold: } ~~ \nonumber \\
 &  & 
Y \indep X  \given Z, ~~ 
Y \indep Z  \given X, ~~
X \indep Z  \given Y, ~~ 
Y \indep X, ~~ 
Y \indep Z, ~
\mbox{ and } ~
X \indep Z   
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
When only the binary operation is called
for, either the prefix or infix notation can be used depending on which seems clearer in the context.

As always, conditioning variables  or events appear to the right of a vertical line
(if more than one variable is conditioned on, as in @Dawid1979, they can appear listed 
separately within parentheses
after the vertical bar). The prefix notation $\indep (Y, \cdots , Z)$ is intended 
to indicate the complete probabilistic independence
of its arguments which, as with pairwise independence, can occur for its
arguments either unconditionally or conditionally given other random variables 
or events. So,
\begin{eqnarray}
\indep (Y, X, Z) \given W
 & \mbox{  means } & 
\indep (Y, X) \given (Z, W),~~  
\indep (Y, Z) \given (X, W),~~  
\indep (X, Z) \given (Y, W),~~  \nonumber \\
& & 
\indep (Y, X) \given W, ~~  
\indep (Y, Z) \given W, ~  
\mbox{ and } ~
\indep (X, Z) \given W   \nonumber \\
& & 
\mbox{ all hold }
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
For four variables the recursive definition is
\begin{eqnarray}
\indep (Y, X, Z, W) & ~~\mbox{ means that }~~ &\nonumber \\
&
\indep (Y, X, Z) \given W,&
\indep (Y, X, W) \given Z, ~~  
\indep (Y, Z, W) \given X, ~~  
\indep (X, Z, W) \given Y, ~~ 
 \nonumber \\
& 
\indep (Y, X, Z), &
\indep (Y, X, W), ~~  
\indep (Y, Z, W), ~~ 
\mbox{ and } ~~
\indep (X, Z, W), ~~ 
 \nonumber \\
& 
\mbox{ all hold. }&   \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
The extension of the notation to more than four variables is entirely analogous. 
$\notindep (Y, \cdots , Z)$ means that at least one of the independencies on the right
hand side does not hold.

Given the number of independencies that are entailed, the phrase 
\textit{complete} independence seems more evocative of the strength of the
assertion than does the traditional \textit{mutual} independence.  @eikosIndependence studies these relationships in some detail (including linking them to log-linear and graphical models).  

The rest of the vignette explores eikosograms which show the various possible independencies that appear as part of the definition of $\indep(X,Y,Z)$.


# Three variates

The nature of independence relationships becomes much more interesting when there are three variates.  To illustrate, we introduce several different joint probability distributions taken from @eikosIndependence.

## Artificial but illustrative data

Below, we reproduce the data given in Table 1 of @eikosIndependence; the resulting tables of probabilities are used to construct canonical examples. 

```{r conditional independence tables display, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# This function will create all the joint probabilities
# and place them in the appropriate three-way table
create3WayBinaryTable <- function(widths, heights) {
    toprow_eikos <- widths * (1 - heights)
    bottomrow_eikos <- widths * heights
    probs <- array(c(bottomrow_eikos, toprow_eikos),
                  dim = c(2,2,2),
                  dimnames = list(Z = c("z1", "z2"),
                                  X = c("x1", "x2"),
                                  Y = c("y1", "y2")
                  ))
    as.table(probs)
}
# Marginal probabilities (widths) for 
# the two binary conditioning variates
# are given by the xz values,
# and the conditional probabilities (heights)
# for the response variate's first value
# are given by the b values.
# Figure numbers here refer to those figure numbers of
# the original Oldford (2003) article entitled
# "Understanding probabilistic independence and its 
#  modelling via Eikosograms and graphs."
xz1 <- c(2/7, 8/35, 1/7, 12/35)
b1 <- c(4/5, 1/2, 3/10, 7/10)
fig5a_data <-  create3WayBinaryTable(xz1, b1)
b2 <- c(4/5, 1/2, 3/5, 1/5)
fig5b_data <-  create3WayBinaryTable(xz1, b2)
b3 <- c(4/5, 1/2, 4/5, 1/2)
fig5c_data <-  create3WayBinaryTable(xz1, b3)
b4 <- c(7/10, 7/10, 7/10, 7/10)
fig6_data <- create3WayBinaryTable(xz1, b4)
xz2 <- c(10/33, 4/11, 5/33, 2/11)
fig7_data <- create3WayBinaryTable(xz2, b4)
xz3 <- c(1/3, 1/6, 1/3, 1/6)
b5 <- c(7/10, 7/10, 3/10, 3/10)
fig8_data <- create3WayBinaryTable(xz2, b5)
xz4 <- c(2/9, 1/9, 2/9, 4/9)
b6 <- c(2/3, 2/3, 1/6, 1/6)
fig9_data <- create3WayBinaryTable(xz4, b6)
xz5 <- c(1/7, 1/7, 3/7, 2/7)
b7 <- c(1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 1/6)
fig11_data <- create3WayBinaryTable(xz5, b7)
xz6 <- c(1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4)
b8 <- c(3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/4)
fig12_data <- create3WayBinary Table(xz6, b8)
xz7 <- c(1/3, 1/6, 1/3, 1/6)
b9 <- c(2/3, 1/2, 5/6, 1/6)
fig13_data <- create3WayBinaryTable(xz7, b9)
xz8 <- c(1/6, 1/3, 1/6, 1/3)
b10 <- c(1/6, 2/3, 5/6, 1/3)
fig14_data <- create3WayBinaryTable(xz8, b10)

# Create this now for early illustration
cond_indep <- fig5c_data
```

Each table gives the joint probabilities for all $2^3 = 8$ combinations; for example the last table looks like
```{r}
fig14_data
sum(fig14_data)
```

We will be using these data to illustate the various possible configurations of independent relations between three variates. (For example, the `cond_indep` used earlier is `fig5c_data`.)

## Possible eikosograms

For three variates, say $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, a great many  eikosograms are possibly of interest. 

To begin with any one of the three variates can be chosen as the response variate (or vertical axis), with the combinations of the remaining two appearing as conditioning variates.  The order of the conditioning variates (and possibly their values) could be rearranged to produce further variations in the display.  

We also need to consider the eikosograms of every pair of variates **unconditionally**. That is, we need to consider the joint distribution of each pair without any consideration of the third variate (i.e. marginalizing over the third). 
For each pair, two substantively different eikosograms arise from alternating the two variates' roles between response or conditioning variates

It turns out that there are only nine substantively different types of independence relationships between three categorical variates.  These will be illustrated in turn below.  

## Case 1: complete independence

When $\indep(X, Y, Z)$ holds, we have complete independence.  The joint distribution can be shown in three different eikosograms depending on which variate is the response.
```{r complete independence code, eval = FALSE}
complete_indep <- fig7_data
eikosY <- eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
                xaxs = FALSE, yaxs= FALSE,
                data = complete_indep, draw = FALSE)
eikosX <- eikos(y="X", x = c("Z", "Y"), 
                xaxs = FALSE, yaxs= FALSE,
                data = complete_indep, draw = FALSE)
eikosZ <- eikos(y="Z", x = c("X", "Y"), 
                xaxs = FALSE, yaxs= FALSE,
                data = complete_indep, draw = FALSE)
```

```{r complete independence eikos, echo = FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=3.5, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
complete_indep <- fig7_data
eikosY <- eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
                xaxs = FALSE, yaxs= FALSE,
                data = complete_indep, draw = FALSE)
eikosX <- eikos(y="X", x = c("Z", "Y"), 
                xaxs = FALSE, yaxs= FALSE,
                data = complete_indep, draw = FALSE)
eikosZ <- eikos(y="Z", x = c("X", "Y"), 
                xaxs = FALSE, yaxs= FALSE,
                data = complete_indep, draw = FALSE)
```


```{r complete independence arrange 3, echo = TRUE, fig.width=12, fig.height=3.5, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Complete independence", out.width="100%"}
grid.arrange(eikosY, eikosX, eikosZ, nrow=1)
```

```{r}
eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz1, b2))

eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz1, b3))
eikos(y="Y", x = c("X", "Z"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz1, b3))

eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz1, b4))


eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz2, b4))
eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz3, b5))
eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz4, b6))
eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz5, b7))
eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz6, b8))
eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz7, b9))
eikos(y="Y", x = c("Z", "X"), 
      data = create3WayBinaryTable(xz8, b10))

```
